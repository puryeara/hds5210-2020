# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
49 / 50

Really great work.  Thanks for going above and beyond with the questionable input check and adding the stats at the end, too.  Nice.

## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  They all look great.  I like how you added the ranges and percents also.  Great to have.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - These all look great in general.  Nice use of the generic function to do the scoring for many of the inputs without duplicating code.

Your FiO2 section used the FiO2 ranges niicely, but then had to hardcode getting either the 'Pa02' or 'A-a gradient' value sets.  If you had restructured your JSON slightly, then this wouldn't have needed to have that informaiton either.  (-1)

Nice work with the testing!!

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.

I like the way you added some sanity checks to the input values.  Those are always great to have!

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Really nice work.  I'm sad that so many of these patients are going to die though.  :(
